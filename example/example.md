This example manuscript is intended to serve as a tutorial and template for
authors to use when writing their own AAS Journal articles. The manuscript
includes a history of \aastex\ and documents the new features in the previous
versions as well as the bug fixes in version 6.31. This manuscript includes many
figure and table examples to illustrate these new features.  Information on
features not explicitly mentioned in the article can be viewed in the manuscript
comments or more extensive online documentation. Authors are welcome replace the
text, tables, figures, and bibliography with their own and submit the resulting
manuscript to the AAS Journals peer review system.  The first lesson in the
tutorial is to remind authors that the AAS Journals, the Astrophysical Journal
(ApJ), the Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL), the Astronomical Journal (AJ),
and the Planetary Science Journal (PSJ) all have a 250 word limit for the
abstract.  If you exceed this length the
Editorial office will ask you to shorten it. This abstract has 182 words.
